** How to add links to images

Links to images can be added like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
I want a link to an image:

[[images/myImage.png][images/myImage.png]]

This will display a small image, and the original image can be accessed by 
clicking on it.

If I want a text link to an image, this can be done like
[[images/myOtherImage.png][this]].
#+END_SRC
